order of over $35?
Some filters to help:
• where visit_date between X and Y
• and channel = 'DOTCOM'
• and service_id in (8, 11)

Answer:

Points to note:
-Since we have an Item_id in the data, we have to group the data first at Order level
-Assming the date is present as 'mm/dd/yyyy' in string
WITH grouping_order 
     AS (SELECT ugc_id, 
                group_order_nbr, 
                Sum(amount) AS amount, 
                Sum(qty)    AS qty 
         FROM   table 
         WHERE  TO_DATE(visit_date,'mm/dd/yyyy') BETWEEN '01-01-2018' AND '12-31-2018' 
                AND channel = 'DOTCOM' 
                AND service_id IN ( 8, 11 ) 
         GROUP  BY ugc_id, 
                   group_order_nbr), 
     cust_flag 
     AS (SELECT ugc_id, 
                CASE 
                  WHEN Max(amount) <= 35 THEN 1 
                  ELSE 0 
                END AS cust_above_35 
         FROM   grouping_order 
         GROUP  BY ugc_id) 
SELECT Sum(cust_above_35) AS count, 
       Sum(cust_above_35) * 100 / Count(ugc_id) 
FROM   cust_flag



2. Cumulative revenue for “DOTCOM” and “OG” separately until end of each month of 2017 i.e. total revenue until end of
Jan’17, Feb’17, until end of March’17… until end of Dec’17

--Points to note
-- As per my understanding of the question, I have to find cummulative_sales

WITH monthly_sales 
		AS (SELECT  channel,
					EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE(visit_date,'mm/dd/yyyy')) as year,
					EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_DATE(visit_date,'mm/dd/yyyy')) as month,
					sum(amount) as monthly_Sales
			FROM    table
			WHERE   channel in ('DOTCOM', 'OG')
			AND 	EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE(visit_date,'mm/dd/yyyy')) = 2017
			GROUP BY 1,2)
SELECT 	year,
		month,
		monthly_Sales,
		SUM(monthly_sales) OVER(PARTITION BY channel order by month ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING) as cummulative_sales
FROM monthly_sales

3. For each quarter of a year - what percentage of shoppers (dotcom only) shopping in a fiscal quarter, will shop again (repeat)
in the following quarter? You’d have to look at Q1 for the year to get repeat rate for Q4 of current year

--Ponits to note
--using lead function
--using mod function to validate data of last quarter of a year against first quarter of next year

WITH next_quarter 
	AS (SELECT	ugc_id,
				EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE(visit_date,'mm/dd/yyyy')) as year,
				EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM TO_DATE(visit_date,'mm/dd/yyyy')) as quarter,
				LEAD(visit_date,1,NULL) OVER(PARTITION BY ugc_id ORDER BY visit_date) as next_visit
		From 	table
		WHERE 	channel = 'DOTCOM'),

	next_quarter_distinct 
	AS (SELECT	ugc_id,
				year,
				quarter,max(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE(next_visit,'mm/dd/yyyy'))= year and 
				(MOD(quarter,4)+1)=EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM TO_DATE(next_visit,'mm/dd/yyyy')) then 1 else 0 end as flag) as next_qtr_flag
		From 	next_quarter
		GROUP BY 1,2,3
)	
SELECT 	year,
		quarter,
		sum(next_qtr_flag) as count, 
		sum(next_qtr_flag)/count(next_qtr_flag) as per
FROM next_quarter_distinct
GROUP BY 1,2
